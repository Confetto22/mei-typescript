          OUR SUCCESS STORY
        </h2>
        <p>
          The LORD commissioned Dr. Cloudio in 2016 to begin this ministry which
          the Lord Christened, Maranatha Word Chapel International (MWCI). The
          church begun at Ablekuma with seven people. The church continued
          steadfastly in sharing the word, prayer and fasting. God&apos;s power
          became imminent in every MWCI&apos;s service and the church begun to
          grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          The church transitioned from Ablekuma to Santa Maria where the church
          continued to blossom. God through the anointing he has bestowed upon
          His manservant manifested countless magnificent and incredible
          miracles in the lives of people who fellowshipped with the church. The
          move of God was so strong; some of those testimonies were so mind
          blowing that till today it still marvels dozens of people.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2021 the Lord directed His manservant to rebrand the church from
          MWCI to House of Mystery Chapel International (HoM Chapel). HoM Chapel
          has been the hub of mysterious insight into deep revelations in Godâ€™s
          word, miracles, signs and wonders.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2022 we faced a very challenging time in the history of this church
          when we had to move from Santa Maria to Weija. The Head Pastor had to
          sell everything he had including his lands, cars and anything he could
          lay hands on. He sold them all to build this beautiful auditorium for
          God; the mystery temple.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was moments of toil, labor and sleepless nights. But God came
          through for the ministry and gave us divine enablement to finish and
          furnish this place. Through the grace and the mercies of God we have
          grown over the years into an avalanche of startling and awesome group
          of citizens of the kingdom of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And guess what, God is now doing even much more greater and amazing
          things in the life of citizens, bringing about greater testimonies to
          the glory of God. There's no denying that this church community, is a
          gift from the Lord Himself. In fact, this church is nothing short of a
          miracle and we give all the thanks and glory to God.
